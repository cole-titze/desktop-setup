# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

Desktop bootstrap scripts for two setups:
- **`kubuntu/`** — Kubuntu 24.04 LTS full desktop: KDE Plasma settings, dev tools, Steam/Sunshine for remote gaming, Docker, Minecraft Bedrock server, SSH
- **`bazzite/`** — Bazzite (Fedora-based immutable OS): dev tools + Minecraft only (Steam/gaming is pre-installed on Bazzite)

## Running the bootstrap

```bash
# Kubuntu — full run (interactive)
bash kubuntu/setup.sh

# Bazzite — full run (interactive)
bash bazzite/setup.sh

# Run a single step directly
bash bazzite/steps/05-resolution-toggle.sh
```

## Architecture

Each `setup.sh` discovers all `steps/*.sh` files, sorts them by filename, and runs them in order, pausing for confirmation between each. Steps are plain bash with `set -euo pipefail`.

**Kubuntu step numbering:**
- `00–09` — OS prep (apt update, essentials)
- `10–19` — CLI packages
- `20–29` — Gaming layer (Steam, Sunshine/Moonlight)
- `30–39` — Dev toolchain (.NET 9, nvm/Node LTS, GitHub CLI, sqlpackage, Claude Code)
- `40–49` — IDE (VS Code + settings)
- `50–59` — Containers (Docker)
- `60–69` — Services (Minecraft Bedrock server via Docker + systemd + backup hook)
- `80–89` — SSH (keygen, sshd)
- `90–99` — Cleanup

**Bazzite step numbering:**
- `05` — iPad resolution toggle script + Desktop shortcut
- `10–15` — Dev toolchain (rpm-ostree CLI tools, gh, .NET, nvm/Node, VS Code, Claude Code, SSH)
- `20–22` — Minecraft Bedrock server (Podman) + systemd + backup hook

**`kubuntu/files/` directory:**
- `bedrock.service` — systemd unit for the Bedrock Docker container
- `bedrock-backup.conf` — systemd drop-in that triggers `bedrock-backup.sh` on service stop
- `bedrock-backup.sh` — tarballs `/opt/bedrock/data/worlds`, keeps last 15 backups in `/opt/bedrock/backups`
- `bedrock.env` — runtime config for the `itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server` Docker image
- `wallpaper.jpg` — set via `plasma-apply-wallpaperimage` in step 01

**`bazzite/files/` directory:**
- `resolution-toggle.sh` — toggles DP-1 and HDMI-A-1 on/off for iPad Sunshine streaming; installed to `~/scripts/`
- `resolution-toggle.desktop` — KDE desktop shortcut for the toggle script; installed to `~/Desktop/` and trusted via `gio`
- `bedrock.service`, `bedrock-backup.conf`, `bedrock-backup.sh`, `bedrock.env` — same Minecraft assets as Kubuntu but for Podman

## Key conventions

- Steps must be idempotent where practical (check before installing, guard with `command -v` or `rpm -q`).
- Each step ends with `echo "<NN>-stepname complete"` for clear progress output.
- Steps that install interactive tools (e.g., Claude Code) print a follow-up instruction rather than attempting automation.
- nvm is installed via the upstream curl script; subsequent `nvm` calls in the same step require sourcing `$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh` and temporarily disabling `set -u`.
- Git identity is hardcoded in `11-gitconfig.sh` (Bazzite) / `31-gitconfig.sh` (Kubuntu) — update when adapting for a new user.
- On Bazzite, never run `kscreen-doctor output.<name>.mode.<resolution>` — it blacks out the screen on NVIDIA/Wayland. `.enable`/`.disable`/`.position.` are safe. Give the `.mode.` command to the user to run themselves.
- On Bazzite, `sudo rpm-ostree kargs` cannot be run through Claude Code's Bash tool — it needs a real TTY for the password. Give the exact command to the user to run at their own terminal.
- `~/.config/kwinoutputconfig.json`'s `"setups"` section persists a separate enabled/disabled layout per unique set of connected outputs. If physical monitors were ever disabled (e.g. via `resolution-toggle.sh`) while the DP-2 virtual display was connected, KWin saves that as the default for "these outputs connected" and silently reapplies it — including disabling physical monitors — on every future boot where DP-2 is connected, independent of whether the toggle script actually ran. See the iPad-streaming troubleshooting section in the README.

## Post-bootstrap manual steps

**Kubuntu:**
1. Add `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to GitHub SSH keys
2. Add DHCP reservation in Pi-hole for a static IP
3. Enable auto-login in KDE System Settings > Users (Steam console experience)
4. Copy Minecraft world backups to `/opt/bedrock/data/worlds`
5. Set monitor refresh rate to max
6. Connect Moonlight to `https://localhost:47990` for initial Sunshine pairing

**Bazzite:**
1. Add `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to GitHub SSH keys
2. Copy Minecraft world backups to `/opt/bedrock/data/worlds`
3. Verify display output names: `kscreen-doctor -o` — update `OUTPUT_PRIMARY`/`OUTPUT_SECONDARY` in `~/scripts/resolution-toggle.sh` if needed
4. For iPad streaming: follow the `crh` EDID injection steps in README to create the 2752×2064 virtual display on DP-2
